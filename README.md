>Colorization is the process of adding color information to visual data (such as black-and-white photos or videos) using computer assistance. It also refers to replacing the brightness value of each pixel in a monochrome image with a multidimensional color vector.

Image colorization is the process of assigning colors to a grayscale image or video to make it more aesthetically appealing and perceptually meaningful. Achieving photo-level quality often requires prior knowledge of the image content. It is a highly complex problem.
